# SBA 308A: JavaScript Web Application

Live link: https://grace1501.github.io/SBA-308A/

## Project name: Developers Hub
An online place where developers and friends can connect and share their favorite quotes about programming. The user can register with their name, email, and favorite quote. If the user doesn't have a favorite quote, the hub will randomly assign a quote to their account. After submiting the form, the user account will appear on page in the same format with other users.

### Objectives:
- Use asynchronous JavaScript tools to build a responsive web application.
- Demonstrate understanding of the JavaScript event loop.
- Generate asynchronous code using Promises and async/await syntax.
- Use fetch and/or Axios to interact with an external web API.
- Organize files using modules and imports.

### Descriptions: 
I use two APIs for the main content of this project:
- https://reqres.in/ to get and post users' info.
- https://programming-quotesapi.vercel.app/ to get the programming quotes (limit: 100 requests per hour).
- I also use https://ui-avatars.com/ to create personalized avatar based on user's first and last name.
